    Conduct a comprehensive technical interview based on the initial technology stack: '{tech_stack_description}'.
    
    You must ask specific, targeted questions to gather complete information about:
    
    **Technology Details:**
    - Exact versions of frameworks, libraries, and tools
    - Programming language versions and specific features used
    - Database types, versions, and configuration approaches
    
    **Infrastructure & Deployment:**
    - Deployment environment (cloud provider, on-premise, hybrid)
    - Containerization approach (Docker, Kubernetes, etc.)
    - Load balancing and scaling mechanisms
    - Network architecture and segmentation
    
    **Data & Security Context:**
    - Types of data being processed (PII, financial, healthcare, etc.)
    - Authentication and authorization mechanisms
    - Compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, PCI-DSS, etc.)
    - Current security measures already in place
    
    **Integration & Dependencies:**
    - Third-party services and APIs used
    - External integrations and data flows
    - Monitoring and logging solutions
    
    Ask follow-up questions based on the responses until you have a complete picture.
    Be conversational but thorough.
